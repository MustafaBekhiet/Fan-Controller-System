# Fan-Controller-System
An embedded project using ATmega32 microcontroller responsible for controlling the fan whether it is on or off depends on the temperature of the room, also controlling the speed of the fan depends on the temperature. Using LM35 temperature sensor will give continuous analog output corresponding to the temperature sensed by it
